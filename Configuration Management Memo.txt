Configuration management is important for any software development lifecycle. It enables a team to work together and continuously develop software with far fewer conflicts along the way. The code base can be worked on by all members simultaneously and any potential errors with merging can be resolved via pull requests. This enables all members to work as efficiently as possible on all of their assigned parts without too much struggle. Software configuration management systems support the ability to work on many different branches of the code base at once. Past versions of the code base will always be available with proper configuration management, meaning that mistakes or poorly-planned merges can be reverted without any trouble. This allows the team to work without a constant fear of the slightest mistake accidentally erasing months of work, which leads to much faster progress. The ability to review each and every pull request before finally merging it into the master branch also allows each group member to catch any potential mistakes before they become serious problems. Different releases of the code can be tracked via a properly established software configuration management system, further enabling the ability to track the progress and direction of the project.
From completing this assignment, I learned how to create my own personal GitHub repository and the commands to keep that repository updated and relevant. I also learned that I had improperly installed git on my machine and struggled to understand why things were not working the way they should, but solving those issues only furthered my understanding of the process.
